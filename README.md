## 👋 Hi there 👋
I'm Scott, and I'm an application developer, father, consultant, coach, writer, and student. **I love creating things**, and look to always be building great things with great people. My favorite conversations are those about someone's goals & ideas and how they are pursuing them. 

**About Me:**
- I experiment and build things in C# (asp.net, Unity, Maui), Javascript (node, express, Vue, Capacitor), and a bit of Python (Django, Flask, cli stuff). 
- I enjoy using lightweight editors (VScode and SublimeText), Docker, Azure Data Studio, Postman, Draw.io, Figma, Trello, and Discord. And Unity but I'm terrible 😅
- Rapid-fire personals: I have two sons and we like to draw, exercise, read stories, and be outside; I like studying app/game design and learning languages; I exercise a lot; my three favorite video games are Gunz:theDuel, SmashBros, and Chess.
